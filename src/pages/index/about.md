## About Me

Hey Iâ€™m Ove, web and software developer specialized in frontend development, based in Hamburg, Germany.

I have been helping companies, brands and agencies building their digital products for quite some time now. This could mean building a website to attract new clients, running a fast and SEO friendly online shop or creating a mobile app, running both on android and ios.

I would love to help you or your clients achieve the same. Just get in touch with a quick email or use the contact form below.
